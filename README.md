# Generative_AI

I'm currently learning about generative AI and actively working on various projects in this area. These projects include experiments with different models and implementations of generative techniques. You can find the files and projects I'm currently working on in my GitHub repository. This journey is enhancing my understanding and skills in generative AI, and I'm excited to continue exploring its potential applications.
